These exquisitely detailed turtle earrings contain authentic howlite, quartzite, and seashell chips surrounding genuine freshwater pearls 😍
I’m selling these sweet babies for just $25 a pair with 20% of profits donated to @happinessnowdr, a nonprofit that helps provide Haitian refugees in the Dominican Republic with ongoing sources of food, clean water, education, and medical and dental care. Their mission is to raise leaders, empower communities, and to help people help themselves 🙌🏼🙌🏾🙌🏿

I encourage you to hop over to their page and give them a follow, and also consider picking up some beautiful earrings for yourself or a loved one that you know will contribute to a good cause 🦋🙏🏼🏝

Available to provide masked delivery in or around the St. Louis, MO area, or I can send in the mail for an added shipping fee 😘
