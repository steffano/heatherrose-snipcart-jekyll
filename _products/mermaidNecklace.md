Hand-made with L❤️VE by me, this truly distinctive necklace is a real conversation starter! It contains genuine semi-precious amazonite, aventurine, fancy jasper, and 2 rare and legendary black pearls flanked by seashells in their natural colors 💎📿🐚 These authentic gemstones sit alongside vintage jewelry beads to create a one-of-a-kind, wearable work of art! 😍🤩🥰
Fully adjustable from 22“ to 25“ inches ~ model in photo is wearing it on its shortest setting 💖🙏🏼💝 20% of profits will be donated to @happinessnowdr, a nonprofit that helps provide Haitian refugees in the Dominican Republic with ongoing sources of food, clean water, education, and medical and dental care  🏝☀️👨🏾‍⚕️ Their mission is to raise leaders, empower communities, & help people help themselves 🙌🏼🙌🏾🙌🏿
Note: Due to the nature of vintage jewelry, I cannot make claims of authenticity for the beads and stones not explicitly named above. Small defects in raw gemstones, natural seashells, and authentic vintage jewelry are to be expected and part of the unique character of the piece 🖤❣️🤍
